# TowerOfHanoi

## Overview
**TowerOfHanoi** is a Java program that solves the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle for any number of disks. The program demonstrates **recursion**, **arrays as stacks**, and **algorithmic problem-solving** by moving disks between three pillars while following the rules of the puzzle:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one pillar and placing it on another pillar.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

This project highlights the use of **object-oriented programming**, **data structures**, and **step-by-step algorithm visualization**.

## Features
- Solve Tower of Hanoi for any number of disks.
- Display the state of all three pillars after each move.
- Keep track of the number of moves (time steps).
- Works for any starting and target pillars.

---

## Classes
1. **Hanoi** – Main class that implements the solution using recursion and arrays to represent pillars.
   - Tracks the number of disks on each pillar.
   - Prints the state of the pillars after each move.
   - Calculates and displays the total number of steps required.
